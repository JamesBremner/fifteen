 Solve fifteen puzzle


The World-famous Fifteen Puzzle has stumped curious gamers since the 18th century.
Invented by Noyes Chapman, the Fifteen Puzzle is comprised of 15 numbered puzzle pieces
contained in a small 4x4 box that allows each of the numbers to slide around freely
based on the fact that there is always an empty space somewhere on the puzzle board.

The goal of the Fifteen puzzle is to arrange the pieces so that
the top row reads 1-2-3-4 (from left to right),
the second row 5-6-7-8, the third row 9-10-11-12
and the bottom row 13-14-15 with the space in the lower right-hand corner.
